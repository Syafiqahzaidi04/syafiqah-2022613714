    <p>During my internship at the District Education Office (PPD), I had the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of education management at the district level. I was involved in several tasks such as assisting in the preparation of education reports, organizing documents related to the implementation of educational programs, and supporting the scheduling of exams for schools in the district. Additionally, I was involved in school data management, where I helped process and update school information in the PPD system. This experience allowed me to enhance my organizational, communication, and technical skills in the use of educational information systems.I also had the chance to interact with PPD officers, teachers, and school management, which helped me understand the challenges in the education sector and the importance of collaboration in realizing the countryâ€™s education vision and mission. Overall, this experience has strengthened my interest in the field of education and provided valuable exposure to the aspects of management and administration in education.</p>
