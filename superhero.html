    <p>"The superheroes in my life don’t wear capes or possess extraordinary powers. Instead, they carry heavy responsibilities and endless sacrifices, every single day, without a single complaint.</p>

My mother, with her worn yet gentle hands, always ensured I was fed even when she herself went hungry. My father, tired after long hours of work, still found the strength to offer me the warm smile and comforting hug I needed.</p>

They have given up so many of their dreams to give me the chance to chase mine. They ask for nothing in return only to see me happy and successful.</p>

Sometimes, I get so caught up in my own life that I forget the silent sacrifices they’ve made for me. But time has a way of reminding us. Their graying hair, slower steps, and tired faces tell me that even superheroes grow weary and fragile.</p>

To my mom and dad, I’m sorry if I haven’t always shown my gratitude. But please know that every act of love and every sacrifice you’ve made will remain etched in my heart forever. You are, and always will be, the heroes of my life irreplaceable and unmatched.</p>
