    <p>I had the opportunity to be a facilitator for an Arabic language camp with students from UniSZA, Uni Al-Azhar, UUM, and USIM, which took place for 3 days at Maktab Mahmud. The program involved students from Form 1 to Form 3.</p>

On the first day of the camp, as facilitators, we introduced ourselves to the participants so that they could get to know us better. Then, we were assigned to groups to facilitate. I was given the responsibility to manage a group of 10 boys, as we had a shortage of male facilitators. Each group was tasked with creating a slogan and logo on paper, and they were also asked to present their work to everyone.</p>

On the second day, the participants were asked to arrange a set of words into a sentence and look up the meanings using an Arabic dictionary. This activity helped them expand their Arabic vocabulary and improve their communication skills, as well as their ability to work together in groups. As a facilitator, I assisted the participants in solving problems during the activities and provided constructive feedback to support their progress.</p>

On the final day of the camp, I was entrusted with creating a slideshow for the closing ceremony. I was excited to be given this responsibility and to present the slideshow to the audience at the school.</p>

At the end of the program, I received very positive feedback from the participants. They felt more confident in their skills and appreciated all the activities conducted. They mentioned that they now have a better understanding of how to communicate effectively and solve problems as a team. I also helped some participants overcome their lack of confidence and encouraged them to challenge themselves</p>
